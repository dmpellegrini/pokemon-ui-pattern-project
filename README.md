# Danny's Pokémon Selector

Welcome to Danny's Pokémon Selector.

Like previous projects, this one is also simple. You load the webpage in your favorite browser,
look around, and click on your favorite Pokemon.

Once you do you, will get a modal displaying the pokemon's name, pokedex number and type
(Grass, Fire, Water etc...).  The region was sourced manually for simplicity.  

## How To Use 

1. Click on any Pokemon of which you want more info.
1. Click the exit button to return to the page full of pokemon sprites.

### Technical Specs 

- The web page was sourced from (https://pokeapi.co/) the free Pokémon API.
- The API is a consumption only API and only accepts get requests
- For those who care, only the first 151 Pokémon have been included for demonstration excercises.
- Later features will hopefully include evolution chains and a slider to accomodate it.
